# 6502js
A JavaScript 6502 assembler and simulator which runs in a web browser, forked from: https://github.com/ctyler/6502js (originally from https://github.com/skilldrick/6502js)

The ctyler enhancements include a speed control (slider), load/save buttons, an 80x25 character memory-mapped terminal screen, and some basic ROM routines. This version also contains experimental syntax highlighting utilizing Code Bedder (https://codebedder.com/) and Prism.js (https://prismjs.com/).

This fork further enhances the CSS to adjust the look and feel. This fork also makes several modifications to the assembler to add more directives and some simple expressions with working with labels.

A hosted copy is available at http://6502.cdot.systems - Click the "Notes" button and scroll through the text box at the bottom of the display for basic documentation, including links to some sample code. Some sample code to run within the emulator is available at https://github.com/ctyler/6502js-code
